`rpysh` is a Remote Python shell, for Linux Pythoners coping with Windows.

If we have to cope with some Windows things, it's not so comfortable to have:
* Emacs/Vi style key binding
* Tab completion
* Select & paste among X Window clients
* Comfortable and highly configurable window managers
* ....

So `rpysh` comes to rescue!
